## Tyrannosaurus Hex (10)

Hexadecimal is a numeric system in which digit values vary by a power of 16 (instead of by 10, as in decimal), so `0x123` = 3 + 2 * 16 + 1 * 16^2 = 3 + 32 + 256 = 291.

Converting a number this large by hand would be silly, but it's easy to convert using the internet.  Searching "0xabc35a8f to decimal" on Google gives the conversion, and therefore the flag: `2881706639`.
